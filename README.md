# What Am I?
An attempt at implementing an Iterative Deepening Search to find the shortest path from an initial point (I) to the goal (G).

This takes a while so I'm sure there is a way of optimizing it, but it's really cool to visualise it too!

## Build
```bash
javac -cp bin src/IDSearch.java
```

## Run 
```bash
java -cp bin IDSearch <grid number 0-4>
```
